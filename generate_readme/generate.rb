# Awesome ER Diagrams

[![Awesome](_static/awesome.png)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Discover a curated selection of [Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)](https://liambx.com/glossary/erd) from open-source projects. Each diagram represents an actively maintained codebase, offering insights into how developers architect and manage their relational databases.

## Why Explore These?

- **Streamline Onboarding & Contributions**: By visualizing a database schema, you can quickly comprehend an open-source project’s structure, making it easier to submit valuable commits and stay engaged in the development process.
- **Refactoring & Design Inspiration**: Observe how various projects design their data models, define foreign keys, and optimize performance—sparking fresh ideas for your own applications.
- **Hands-On Database Learning**: Compare different schema designs to strengthen your database modeling skills and deepen your understanding of best practices.
